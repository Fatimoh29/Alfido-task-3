## üìä Dashboard Features and Visual Insights  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Total Revenue and Consumer Metrics**  

- **Total Revenue (552M):** Represents total earnings generated across all transactions.  
- **Total Consumers (202K):** The number of unique customers who engaged with the platform.  
- **Active Consumers (162K):** Consumers actively making purchases.  

**Insight:**  
The business has a strong revenue base, but only **80% of consumers** are active, leaving **20% inactive**.  

**Recommendation:**  
- Implement re-engagement campaigns (emails, discounts) to target inactive customers.  
- Introduce loyalty programs to retain active consumers.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Churn Analysis**  

- **19.94% Churn Rate**  
- **162K Active Consumers**  
- **40K Inactive Consumers**  

**Insight:**  
While a churn rate below 20% is reasonable, understanding why **40K customers** become inactive can help improve retention. Common reasons may include dissatisfaction with products or first-time buyers who do not return.  

**Recommendation:**  
- Conduct feedback surveys to understand dissatisfaction drivers.  
- Use predictive analytics to identify at-risk customers and provide personalized offers.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Return Rate Analysis**  

- **49.79% Failed Transactions**  
- **50.21% Successful Transactions**  

**Insight:**  
A nearly equal split between successful and failed transactions highlights potential issues in the purchasing process, such as payment failures or product cancellations.  

**Recommendation:**  
- Improve product quality and descriptions to align with customer expectations.  
- Streamline the return process and provide tutorials to minimize failed transactions.

- **PayPal (179K):** Widely used, indicating customer preference for digital wallets.  
- **Crypto (54K):** Lowest adoption rate.  

**Insight:**  
Credit cards dominate, but the rising use of digital wallets like PayPal highlights the need for secure, flexible payment options.  

**Recommendation:**  
- Promote crypto payment discounts to encourage adoption.  
- Ensure seamless integration of digital wallets to enhance convenience.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Monthly Sales Trends**  

- **Consistent Sales (2020‚Äì2022):** Average of 41.3M per month.  
- **2023 Sales Decline:** Dropped to 29.6M.  

**Insight:**  
The decline in 2023 suggests reduced customer engagement or market slowdown.  

**Recommendation:**  
- Launch seasonal campaigns or new product lines to re-engage customers.
